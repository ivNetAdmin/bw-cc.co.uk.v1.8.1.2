                    a guardian, or hold some other position. However I only want to log into the website using a single login account and view any 
                    relevant information I need for any of my roles in one place, "myclub". </td>

                    As new member who wishes to join the club I can register via the website.
                    If I am a junior then I must be registered by at leaset one guardian who can then add me as their responsibility. 
                    As a junior I can only be contacted via my guardian(s).
                    After registration has been completed I will br sent my personal website login details.
                    When I log in using these details I will have access to the "myclub" webpage.

                    My user name will me by firstname and surname joined by a period (eg tom.jones). 
                    I be given an initial password like my username; firstname lowercase, firstname uppercase 
                    and the digit 9 (eg tomTOM9). However the first timeI log into the site 
                    I will be asked to change it after that I can change my password at any time I wish.

                    As a club official when I need to contact a guardian I don't really care what their name is unless I wish to be polite 
                    but I do need both a valid eMail and telephone number. There is no point Billie having both parents contact details stored 
                    in the system if the telephone and email information is the same. (This means that guardians can change thier name 
                    but must provide a unique email and telephone number.)

                <td>
                    As new member who wishes to join the club I must register via the website.
                    If I am a junior then I must be registered by at leaset one guardian who can then add me as their responsibility.
                    As a junior I can only be contacted via my guardian(s).
                    After registration has been completed I will be sent my personal website login details.

                <td>
                    If I am a junior then my username is my firstname followed by my surname separated by a period (eg tom.jones).
                    If I am not a junior then my user name is my email address.
                    I will be given an initial password which will be my firstname lowercase, firstname uppercase
                    and the digit 1 (eg tomTOM1). However the first time I log into the site
                    I will be asked to change it, after that I can change my password at any time I wish.
                    My username has to be unique so as a gaurdian I cannot share an email address to register. As a junior if my name Tom Jones is not unqiue then my username will contain a number in order to make it unique eg tom1.jones.

                    After completing the on-line registration forms, as the guardian registering, I will be presented with a summary page listing the

                <td>
                    As an adult member I want to maintain my own registration details such as address, telephone number, etc. I may also need to add further
                    juniors I am guardian for or add another guardian to be responsible for my own wards. I cannot however change the names of my wards or my own email address
                    using the registration upkeep functions as this will affect a member's login username. See "Change Username" user story for this function. In addition a guardian
                    responsible for more than one junior cannot register another guardian to be responsible for some of registering guardians wards. The additional guardian has to be
                    responsible for all the original guardians junior responsibilities.

                    I want the system to automatically eMail the new member with their "My Club" log in details. Until I vet each new registrant (activate) 
                    I will not be able to see them in the all member list. Before activation I can delete new registrants but after activation I cannot. I can only deactivate them.

                    As an administrator I want to search for a member and then be able to change their registration details. I will not however be able to change email addresses or member names.
                    I will be able to set members as active or not. Inactive members will not be able to access their "My Club" page. If I set a guardian to inactive all of their
                    junior wards will also be set to inactive unless they have another "active" guardian.
